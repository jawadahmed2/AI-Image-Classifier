# Image Classifier
## AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

This repository contains an AI image classifier project developed using Python. The image classifier leverages deep learning techniques and utilizes popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras. It is trained on a large dataset of images and can accurately classify objects in images with high accuracy. The project also includes detailed documentation and instructions on how to use the classifier in your own applications. Feel free to explore the code.
