# PyTorch Image Classifier - Flowers-102 Dataset

This repository contains an image classifier project developed using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library. The image classifier is trained on the Flowers-102 dataset, which can be accessed at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html. The dataset consists of 102 categories of flowers, making it a challenging and diverse dataset for training the model.

The project's code includes the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch, which achieves high accuracy in classifying flower images. The repository also contains instructions on how to set up the environment, download the dataset, and train the model.
